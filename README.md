# 🚗 Self-Driving Car Simulation

A browser-based simulation of a self-driving car built using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of autonomous driving, including sensor integration, neural network decision-making, and real-time visualization.

## 🧠 Features

- **Sensor Simulation**: Implements virtual sensors to detect road boundaries and obstacles.
- **Neural Network Control**: Utilizes a simple neural network to determine steering decisions based on sensor inputs.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Visualizes the car's perception and decision-making processes in real-time.
- **Interactive Interface**: Allows users to observe and understand the inner workings of a self-driving system.
